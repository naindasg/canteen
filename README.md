How to run the Stripe API:

This is the customer side of the canteen app. 

In order to run the app, you must do the following: 

1) Download the files in the Stripe API repository and store it in a folder of your choice. 
2) Open up the command prompt and use the "cd" command to change to the folder that contains all of the files of the Stripe API repository. 
3) Enter "node server.js" to run the server.js file 
4) After seeing "Node server listening on port 4242", you can now run the android application, and the Stripe (payment) system should now be working effectively. 
5) When using the app, use the card number "4242 4242 4242 4242", but the rest of the details (e.g. postcode, CVC etc) can be anything.
